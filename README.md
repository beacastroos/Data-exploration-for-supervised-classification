# Data-exploration-for-supervised-classification

## About the project

Development of a machine learning pipeline for the Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) dataset to predict patient survival one year after diagnosis.

The project was created in a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) document.

## Prerequisites

To run the project, the following libraries are required:

* matplotlib
  ```sh
  pip install matplotlib
  ```
* seaborn
    ```sh
  pip install seaborn
  ```
* pandas
    ```sh
  pip install pandas
  ```
* scikit-learn
    ```sh
  pip install -U scikit-learn
  ```
* numpy
    ```sh
  pip install numpy
  ```

## How to compile

Download the files ``EIACD2.ipynb`` and ``hcc_dataset.csv`` and run the ``EIACD2.ipynb`` file.

## Results

Data analysis, testing of different algorithms with both processed and unprocessed data, and evaluation of prediction results using various algorithms.
